# Java Rental Shop

**A vehicle rental management system implemented in Java.**

## Description

This project is a Java-based system designed to manage the operations of a vehicle rental shop. It tracks vehicles that are in the shop's garage (available for rent) and those currently rented out to customers. The system allows for adding new vehicles, marking vehicles as rented or returned, searching for available vehicles, and generating reports on rental activity. It serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming and data management in a real-world scenario.

## Key Features

*   **Vehicle Inventory Management:** Add, view, update, and delete vehicles from the shop's inventory.
*   **Rental Tracking:** Track which vehicles are currently rented, the rental dates, and customer information.
*   **Availability Management:**  Easily identify which vehicles are available for rent at any given time.
*   **Search Functionality:** Search for vehicles based on various criteria (e.g., make, model, type).
*   **Reporting:** Generate reports on rental activity, such as daily rentals, popular vehicles, and revenue.

## Potential Improvements

*   **GUI Implementation:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
*   **Database Integration:** Persist data to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) instead of in-memory storage.
*   **Customer Management:** Add functionality to manage customer profiles and rental history.
*   **Pricing and Billing:** Implement a pricing system and generate invoices for rentals.
*   **Advanced Reporting:**  Add more detailed reporting capabilities, such as revenue analysis and vehicle utilization.
